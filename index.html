            <h4>What is a Factorial?</h4>
            <p>A factorial is a mathematical function that multiplies a number by every integer below it, down to 1. It
                is commonly denoted by an exclamation mark.</p>

        <div class="card">
            <h4>Factorial Formula</h4>
            <p>The general formula for calculating the factorial of a number <code>n</code> is:
                <code>n! = n × (n - 1) × (n - 2) × ... × 1</code>
            </p>

            <h4>History of Factorials</h4>
            <p>The modern notation of the factorial symbol "<code>!</code>" was introduced by the French mathematician
                <strong>Christian Kramp</strong> in 1808.

                <h3>Understanding Factorial Calculations</h3>
                <p>In this blog post, we dive deep into the different approaches to calculating factorials. Factorials
                    can be computed either iteratively or recursively. Both methods have their pros and cons depending
                    on the scenario. An iterative approach involves using a loop to calculate the factorial of a number,
                    while a recursive approach uses the function calling itself to achieve the same result.</p>
                <p>Factorial calculations are fundamental in various algorithms, particularly in combinatorics,
                    probability, and number theory. Understanding these methods is key to solving complex mathematical
                    problems efficiently. We also explore how large numbers can be factored quickly using these
                    techniques, and the importance of choosing the right approach for your problem.</p>

                <h3>Why is Factorial Important in Programming?</h3>
                <p>Factorial functions are used in many programming algorithms, particularly those that deal with
                    combinations and permutations. In mathematics, the factorial of a number <code>n!</code> is the
                    product of all positive integers less than or equal to <code>n</code>. In programming, the factorial
                    function is often used in combinatorics, cryptography, and calculating binomial coefficients, among
                    other applications.</p>
                <p>By exploring how to calculate factorials programmatically, you gain insights into recursive functions
                    and iterative loops. This blog post covers different ways to implement factorial functions in
                    programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, and C++.</p>

                <h3>Applications of Factorial in Real Life</h3>
                <p>Factorials have broad applications in the real world, especially in statistics, combinatorics, and
                    probability theory. For example, factorials are used to calculate the number of ways to arrange a
                    set of objects, which is essential in probability problems and game theory. You’ll find factorials
                    in everyday applications like calculating probabilities in card games or predicting the outcome of
                    random events.</p>
                <p>Beyond games, factorials are used in data analysis, cryptography, and even machine learning
                    algorithms where permutations and combinations are needed to evaluate different model parameters.

                <h3>Factorial in Probability and Statistics</h3>
                <p>In probability and statistics, factorials are crucial when calculating permutations and combinations.
                    The formula for permutations, <code>nPr = n! / (n - r)!</code>, is used to determine how many
                    different ways you can arrange <code>r</code> objects from a set of <code>n</code> objects.
                    Similarly, combinations use factorials to calculate the number of ways to select items from a larger
                    set where the order of selection doesn’t matter.</p>
                <p>Understanding how to manipulate factorials is important for statisticians, particularly when dealing
                    with large datasets and calculating probabilities for various outcomes.</p>
